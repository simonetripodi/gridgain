GridGain is a *Java* and *Scala* based software middleware that enables development
of high performance distributed application that scale up on any managed infrastructure: 
from a single laptop, to cluster and grids, to public and private clouds. 

GridGain allows anyone easily develop, scale and manage compute and data intensive 
JVM based applications.

GridGain provides three major areas of functionality: 

- Compute Grids 
- Data Grids
- Auto-Scaling

[TIP]
.What is GridGain?
*********************************************************************
High Performance Cloud Computing

+or+

GridGain = (Java + Scala) * (Compute Grid + Data Grid + Auto-Scaling)

On top of that it provides the multitude of surrounding technologies many of 
which are frequently used by our clients on their own. 

With GridGain your applications can:

- Work in a zero-deployment mode.
- Scale up or down based on demand.
- Cache distributed data in data grid.
- Co-locate data and computations.
- Run sql queries against cached data.
- Store and query JSON objects.
- Speed up task using MapReduce processing.
- Use distributed thread pools.
- Distribute the workload on the grid.
- Use distributed queues and atomics. 
- Effectively exchange messages.
- Auto-discover all grid resources.
- Execute closures on the grid.
- Grid-enable java and scala code.
- ... and much more

Examples
--------
The best way to get started with GridGain is to look through examples. You can find all 
examples under +examples+ folder right at where you installed GridGain. This folder 
contains examples for Java, Scala and some for Groovy. 

You can simply run these examples from your favorite IDE or just command line. All 
examples have documentation on what they do and some basic configuration tips, if any needed.

We suggest to start with HelloWorld examples located at 
+examples/java/org/gridgain/examples/helloworld+ folder. Getting started is easier with 
documentation on our http://bit.ly/bywKFk[Wiki]

Javadoc & Scaladoc
------------------
We spend significant amount of time on writing and maintaining Javadoc and Scaladoc for our 
product. All documentation is shipped with it and you can find it under +javadoc+ and 
+scaladoc+ sub-folder respectively. 

You can also find latest released Javadoc online: http://www.gridgain.com/javadoc30C/index.html

Scripts
-------
All scripts that you need to use on a regular basis can be found at +bin+ 
sub-folder. To start a grid node with default configuration simply run +bin/ggstart.sh+ or 
+bin\ggstart.bat+ script - *and you are in the grid!*
