/**
 * This is the base class for segmentation (a.k.a "split-brain" problem) resolvers.
 * <p>
 * Each segmentation resolver checks segment for validity, using its inner logic.
 * Typically, resolver should run light-weight single check (i.e. one IP address or
 * one shared folder). Compound segment checks may be performed using several
 * resolvers.
 * <p>
 * Note that GridGain support a logical segmentation and not limited to network
 * related segmentation only. For example, a particular segmentation resolver
 * can check for specific application or service present on the network and
 * mark the topology as segmented in case it is not available. In other words
 * you can equate the service outage with network outage via segmentation resolution
 * and employ the unified approach in dealing with these types of problems.
 * <p>
 * The following implementations are built-in (Enterprise edition only):
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.gridgain.grid.segmentation.reachability.GridReachabilitySegmentationResolver}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gridgain.grid.segmentation.sharedfs.GridSharedFsSegmentationResolver}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gridgain.grid.segmentation.tcp.GridTcpSegmentationResolver}</li>
 * </ul>
