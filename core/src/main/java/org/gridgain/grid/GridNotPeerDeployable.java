/**
 * This annotations should be used to mark any type that should not be

 * <p>
 * This annotation is used as <b>non-distribution assertion</b> and should be
 * applied to classes and interfaces that should never be distributed via
 * peer-to-peer deployment.
 * <p>
 * Note, however, that if class is already available on the remote node it
 * will not be peer-loaded but will simply be locally class loaded. It may appear
 * as if it was successfully peer-loaded when in fact it was simply already
 * available on the remote node.
