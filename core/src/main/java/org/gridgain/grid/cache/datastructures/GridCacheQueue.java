/**
 * This interface provides a rich API for working with Data Grid-based distributed queues.
 * <p>
 * Note that queues are only available in <b>Enterprise Edition</b>.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Overview</h1>
 * Cache queue provides an access to cache elements using typical queue API. Cache queue also implements
 * {@link Collection} interface and provides all methods from collections including
 * {@link Collection#addAll(Collection)}, {@link Collection#removeAll(Collection)}, and
 * {@link Collection#retainAll(Collection)} methods for bulk operations. Note that all
 * {@link Collection} methods in the queue may throw {@link GridRuntimeException} in case
 * of failure. If you prefer to catch checked exceptions, use methods that end with
 * {@code 'x'}, such as {@link #addx(Object)} for example, which throw {@link GridException}.
 * <p>
 * All queue operations have synchronous and asynchronous counterparts.
 * <h1 class="header">Bounded vs Unbounded</h1>
 * Queues can be {@code unbounded} or {@code bounded}. {@code Bounded} queues can
 * have maximum capacity. Queue capacity can be set at creation time and cannot be
 * changed later. Here is an example of how to create {@code bounded} {@code LIFO} queue with
 * capacity of {@code 1000} items.
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridCacheQueue&lt;String&gt; queue = cache().queue("anyName", LIFO, 1000);
 * ...
 * queue.add("item");
 * </pre>
 * For {@code bounded} queues <b>blocking</b> operations, such as {@link #take()} or {@link #put(Object)}
 * are available. These operations will block until queue capacity changes to make the operation
 * possible.
 * <h1 class="header">Queue Types</h1>
 * The following types of queues are available in GridGain:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link GridCacheQueueType#FIFO} (default)</li>
 *      <li>{@link GridCacheQueueType#LIFO}</li>
 *      <li>{@link GridCacheQueueType#PRIORITY}</li>
 * </ul>
 * For more information about queue types refer to {@link GridCacheQueueType} documentation.
 * <p>
 * {@code Priority} queues allow for sorting queue items by priority. Priority in the queue item can
 * be set using annotation {@link GridCacheQueuePriority}. Only one field or method can be annotated
 * with priority in queue item class. Annotated fields or methods must be of {@code int} or {@code Integer}
 * types. Here is an example of how annotate queue item:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * private static class PriorityMethodItem {
 *       // Priority field.
 *       private final int priority;
 *
 *       private PriorityMethodItem(int priority) {
 *           this.priority = priority;
 *       }
 *
 *       // Annotated priority method.
 *       &#64;GridCacheQueuePriority
 *       int priority() {
 *           return priority;
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Collocated vs Non-collocated</h1>
 * Queue items can be placed on one node or distributed throughout grid nodes
 * (governed by {@code collocated} parameter). {@code Non-collocated} mode is provided only
 * for partitioned caches. If {@code collocated} parameter is {@code true}, then all queue items
 * will be collocated on one node, otherwise items will be distributed through all grid nodes.
 * Unless explicitly specified, by default queues are {@code collocated}.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of how create {@code unbounded} {@link GridCacheQueueType#PRIORITY} queue
 * in non-collocated mode.
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridCacheQueue&lt;String&gt; queue = cache().queue("anyName", PRIORITY, 0 &#047;*unbounded*&#047;, false &#047;*non-collocated*&#047;);
 * ...
 * queue.add("item");
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Creating Cache Queues</h1>
 * Instances of distributed cache queues can be created by calling one of the following methods
 * on {@link GridCache} API:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType, int)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType, int, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
